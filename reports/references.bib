  abstract = {Providing reliable estimates of the nuclear data contribution to the uncertainty of well-known integral benchmarks is fundamental to the validation and verification process for a nuclear data library. The Nuclear Energy Agency has produced and maintains the NDaST sensitivity tool, which integrates the DICE sensitivities and nuclear data covariances. This system has been used to rigorously and efficiently provide direct feedback to evaluators and streamline validation. For its future evolution and to identify high-priority development areas, NDaST is continuously compared against state-of-the-art codes that use different uncertainty propagation methodologies.In this work, NDaST was compared to the nuclear data sampling code SANDY for several ICSBEP criticality benchmarks using the JEFF-3.3 evaluated data. Despite excellent overall agreement for cross sections and fission neutron multiplcities, discrepancies due to processed covariance descriptions for angular distributions and prompt fission neutron spectra have identified areas where coordinated development of nuclear data covariance descriptions should be prioritised.},

The proposed methods allow the calculation of the effects of nuclear data perturbation on several response functions: the effective multiplication factor, reaction rate ratios and bilinear ratios (e.g., effective kinetics parameters). SERPENT results are compared to ERANOS and TSUNAMI Generalized Perturbation Theory calculations for two fast metallic systems and for a PWR pin-cell benchmark. New methods for the calculation of sensitivities to angular scattering distributions are also presented, which adopts fully continuous (in energy and angle) Monte Carlo estimators.},
